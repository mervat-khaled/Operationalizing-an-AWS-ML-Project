# Operationalizing an AWS ML Project
## Dog Image Classification
The objective of this project is to finish the following steps:
1. Train and deploy a model on Sagemaker, using the most appropriate instances. Set up multi-instance training in your Sagemaker notebook.
2. Adjust your Sagemaker notebooks to perform training and deployment on EC2.
3. Set up a Lambda function for your deployed model. Set up auto-scaling for your deployed endpoint as well as concurrency for your Lambda function.
4. Ensure that the security on your ML pipeline is set up properly.
Step 1: Training and deployment on Sagemaker:
Created Sagemaker notebook instance I have used ml.t3.large as this is sufficient and has a low cost to run my notebook.
